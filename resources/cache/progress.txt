They're researching spinal cord structure of an infant from a perspective of neural science. To present their findings and proceed with their research, they need an accurate visual representation.\nI will be collaborating with different people in order to complete this CAS. I will need to practice more with sculpting, as I've little experience with it before. And finally, my work will be a part of their research, which is being published this summer.\nSo, the 3D model will consist of 3 layers:\n1. Spinal cord\n2. Nerves\n3. Spine\nI will use Blender for sculpting and rendering",

Try to use some techniques to enhance the lighting even further\n6. Wrap up and polish\nI will be using different lighting sources, such as: Point light, Spot light, Area light and Sun light.\nAlso the I will try to apply the fog to the scene, to make It more mysterious ^_^ ",

This is one of our favorite childhood cartoons, and we want to share our passion with the English speaking audience.\nThe main challenge in this experience is voice acting, because recording process requires some mastering and some of the voice lines are a tongue twisters.\nThis will also take some planning, as translating the whole cartoon In one take is not efficient. We will:\n1. Make a transcript\n2. Translate the original text\n3. Voice over\n4. Add voice effects ",

So, to modify the classic formula, we're going to add protein powder. By doing that we can make them more nutritious and satisfying.

By introducing them to this alternative superior pancake recipe, I hope to inspire them to make more mindful choices when it comes to their diet. Perhaps some of them will be curious to learn more about the benefits of protein powder or explore other healthy ingredients they can incorporate into their cooking!\nIngredients\n- 1 cup all-purpose flour\n- 1 scoop protein \u201cchocolate\u201d powder\n- 2 tsp baking powder\n- 1/4 tsp salt\n- 1 tbsp sugar\n- 1 large egg\n- 1 cup milk\n- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted\nInstructions\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, protein powder, baking powder, salt, and sugar.\n2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, and melted butter.\n3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until well combined.\n4. Heat up a pan\n5. Carefully pour portion of the dough onto pan\n6. Flip the pancake and cook until golden brown on both sides.\n7. Repeat until all of the dough is used up.",

The second important point worth noting is the possibility of collaboration. Since we will work in a group, this can perfectly develop our ability to be united and help each other. It will be a big challenge for us, because we have never had to bake cookies together before and some of us are not so good at this, but those who already know how will teach others. It is our personal choice to selflessly do good to others and cheer them up, so the outcome of the ethics of choices and actions will also be included in this experience.",
